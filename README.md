## how to run the app
```
npm install
npm run dev

cleanup TODOs
- [x] nuke original elements
- [x] getting importing working for JSON, loading structure set up in `+page.js`
- [ ] figure out how to plot the map
- [ ] clean up more code and delete unnecessary files
- [ ] maybe get a style guide so it's not code explosion
- [ ] write some documentation and merge with `master`
